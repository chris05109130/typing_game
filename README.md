Typing Game

Description 

This is also a second time around doing this project because the first time around I was in the begining of learning javascript and i felt like the code I written I could do better which the reason for the redo. For the newest one its simple all you do is choose a level such as easy, medium and hard. Each level you have a certain time limit to type the word. If the time reaches 0 then you loose the game. So basically you type the word as yu see it and if you spell it correctly you get a point. Spell it wrong then you have to fix it before time runs out. Based on your level as each word you type correct more time will be added. Which you will see as you go along.
